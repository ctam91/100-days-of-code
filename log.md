# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Tuesday, October 24th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the exercism pangram coding challenge. Completed a user testing survey for MatchFour game application. 

**Thoughts:** I want to learn more about testing. I was able to use the tests created by exercism. but should learn how to implement my own from scratch. Today, I created a to-do list and it was helpful in terms of organizing my work and visually seeing my accomplishments. I need to make daily to-do lists a habit to boost my productivity.

### Day 1: Wednesday, October 25th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on weather app. I parsed JSON data to utilize weather forecasts. Additionally, my group and I performed user testing today on our MatchFour game. We received a lot of great feedback from our users and I'll be spending the next few days to implement some changes. 

**Thoughts:** User testing was fun and I should ask others to test my applications more often. Through feedback and iterations, I'll be able to improve my skills and create better tools/apps.

### Day 2: Thursday, October 26th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today I spent a lot of time reviewing LinkedLists, Stacks, and Queues. 

**Thoughts:** I am able to implement read and methods, but am having trouble with the delete method. Well, I understand that you are supposed to take the previous node and assign previousNode.next = current.next. However, my code is not passing on Stepik. I've heard from my other classmates that their codes are not passing as well. I guess I'll have to wait until the next class day to ask my instructor. 


### Day 3: Friday, October 27th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today, I researched and learned on how to use AJAX. 

**Thoughts:** AJAX is great. I wish I had discovered it before. I can't wait to use it for my weather app.

### Day 4: Saturday, October 28th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I was finally able to successfully use an AJAX call to retrieve a User's time on MatchFour.

**Thoughts:** I asked a question on StackOverflow about using an AJAX call to post or send data to my backend server, which is written in Java. Someone picked up my post and immediately went to work with how to fix my problem. An issue that I've been mulling over was quickly fixed in about an hour. It pays to reach out for help from others who are more experiences. I was just worried that others wouldn't want to help strangers. I'll definitely look to Stack Overflow for help again in the future.

### Day 5: Sunday, October 29th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I met with my group to talk about our project. We discussed on ways to improve our project and also implemented some feedback we received for user testing. 

**Thoughts:** I love working in groups. It's great when we are able to get together and brainstorm.

### Day 6: Monday, October 30th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I had a mock interview today. 

**Thoughts:** I need to spend more time thinking of my previous work experiences and formulating my responses using the STAR method. For my group project, I implemented redirects to redirect variables.

### Day 7: Tuesday, October 31st, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I added user sessions to our group project. 

**Thoughts:** User sessions were a lot easier than I thought. I wonder if there is a better way to implement user sessions than HTTPSession.

### Day 8: Wednesday, November 1st, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I reviewed data the LinkedList data structure and a binary search. 

**Thoughts:** I need to continue analyzing data structures. It is one thing to learn something, but another thing to continue building one's proficiency on the subject. 


### Day 9: Thursday, November 2nd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed stacks, hash tables, and search algorithms. Also completed the Gigasecond exercism challenge.

**Thoughts:** I need to continue analyzing data structures and practice algorithim scripting challenges.

### Day 10: Friday, November 3rd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my portfolio. Added the main project structure and navigation. 

**Thoughts:** I looked at a lot of developer's portfolios and was amazed by their websites. I kept my website simple with a splash of color. As I continue to develop my own skills, I should also improve my website.

### Day 11: Saturday, November 4th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on MatchFour. Refactored controller, removed UserTime class, and added an AJAX GET request.

**Thoughts:** I found a lot of tutorials to implement a POST request, but not GET. I was starting to get frustrated, but then decided that instead of looking for tutorials, I should just think about what I need to have completed and then try to implement it. So, after thinking about the process (do the POST request backwards), I toyed with my code and was able to successfully implement the GET request to render a user's best time from the database into the browser.

### Day 13: Monday, November 6th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Analyzed the graph data structure and attempted to implement it's methods. 

**Thoughts:** A graph is perhaps the most comples data structure I've come across. I want to dedicate more time to study and use it in practice.


### Day 14: Tuesday, November 7th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finalized my portfolio

### Day 16: Thursday, November 9th, 2017

### Day 19: Sunday, November 12th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today, I spent some time researching how to use the Google Maps Api and how to create a simple maps application. 

**Thoughts:** The Google Maps Api is so well documented! I'm impressed and can't wait to delve more into it.

### Day 20: Monday, November 13th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I spoke with my former teacher on my Google Maps project idea and he thought it was great.  

**Thoughts:** I'm a little anxious because I'm worried that I may have bitten off more than I can chew. However, if my former teacher thinks that I can do it, then I shall try! He suggested I start by adding a custom data layer with the Google Maps Api. I'm not quite sure how to do this yet, but I'm sure I can figure it out.

### Day 21: Tuesday, November 14th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I spent time trying to use the Java Client Library for the Google Maps Api. 

**Thoughts:** I like the Java Client library, however, I don't think it is as robust as the Google Maps JavaScript Api. Do I need to learn JavaScript? I already know the basics such as control flow and how to create variables and POJOs. However, I'm not sure if I enough to be able to complete this project. Well, there is only one way to find out! JavaScript is a great tool and I want to make my project more dynamic.

### Day 24: Friday, November 17th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I fiddled around with the Google Maps marker to put weather icons onto my map. 

**Thoughts:** The markers tutorial on the documentation site is great and extremely useful. I tried looking at some tutorials on YouTube, but the Google documentation was the most helpful. I am defintely going to continue using the documentation first before looking at other tutorials.

### Day 25: Saturday, November 18th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I spent some time refactoring my code and deleting unused classes (since I will not longer be using Java Client Library). 

**Thoughts:** It's good to routinely clean my code.

### Day 26: Sunday, November 19th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I added weather icons to my img folder. 

**Thoughts:** I had an early flight this morning and didn't have much time to work this weekend. It's okay to take slower days to catch up with life.
