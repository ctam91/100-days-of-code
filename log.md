# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Tuesday, October 24th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the exercism pangram coding challenge. Completed a user testing survey for MatchFour game application. 

**Thoughts:** I want to learn more about testing. I was able to use the tests created by exercism. but should learn how to implement my own from scratch. Today, I created a to-do list and it was helpful in terms of organizing my work and visually seeing my accomplishments. I need to make daily to-do lists a habit to boost my productivity.

### Day 1: Wednesday, October 25th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on weather app. I parsed JSON data to utilize weather forecasts. Additionally, my group and I performed user testing today on our MatchFour game. We received a lot of great feedback from our users and I'll be spending the next few days to implement some changes. 

**Thoughts:** User testing was fun and I should ask others to test my applications more often. Through feedback and iterations, I'll be able to improve my skills and create better tools/apps.
