# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Tuesday, October 24th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the exercism pangram coding challenge. Completed a user testing survey for MatchFour game application. 

**Thoughts:** I want to learn more about testing. I was able to use the tests created by exercism. but should learn how to implement my own from scratch. Today, I created a to-do list and it was helpful in terms of organizing my work and visually seeing my accomplishments. I need to make daily to-do lists a habit to boost my productivity.
