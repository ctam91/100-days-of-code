# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Tuesday, October 24th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the exercism pangram coding challenge. Completed a user testing survey for MatchFour game application. 

**Thoughts:** I want to learn more about testing. I was able to use the tests created by exercism. but should learn how to implement my own from scratch. Today, I created a to-do list and it was helpful in terms of organizing my work and visually seeing my accomplishments. I need to make daily to-do lists a habit to boost my productivity.

### Day 1: Wednesday, October 25th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on weather app. I parsed JSON data to utilize weather forecasts. Additionally, my group and I performed user testing today on our MatchFour game. We received a lot of great feedback from our users and I'll be spending the next few days to implement some changes. 

**Thoughts:** User testing was fun and I should ask others to test my applications more often. Through feedback and iterations, I'll be able to improve my skills and create better tools/apps.

### Day 2: Thursday, October 26th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today I spent a lot of time reviewing LinkedLists, Stacks, and Queues. 

**Thoughts:** I am able to implement read and methods, but am having trouble with the delete method. Well, I understand that you are supposed to take the previous node and assign previousNode.next = current.next. However, my code is not passing on Stepik. I've heard from my other classmates that their codes are not passing as well. I guess I'll have to wait until the next class day to ask my instructor. 

### Day 3: Friday, October 27th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today, I researched and learned on how to use AJAX. 

**Thoughts:** AJAX is great. I wish I had discovered it before. I can't wait to use it for my weather app.

### Day 4: Saturday, October 28th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I was finally able to successfully use an AJAX call to retrieve a User's time on MatchFour.

**Thoughts:** I asked a question on StackOverflow about using an AJAX call to post or send data to my backend server, which is written in Java. Someone picked up my post and immediately went to work with how to fix my problem. An issue that I've been mulling over was quickly fixed in about an hour. It pays to reach out for help from others who are more experiences. I was just worried that others wouldn't want to help strangers. I'll definitely look to Stack Overflow for help again in the future.
